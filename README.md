### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
![Algorithms and data structures in action cover](https://github.com/mlarocca/mlarocca/blob/master/LaRocca-ADS-MEAP-low.png)

I'm Marcello, a computer scientist/software engineer, globetrotter and author.

I was born in the South of Italy, raised in Messina, studied in Catania, then lived in Brussels, Naples, Rome, Dublin, Zurich. (And a few more...)

I also worked as a Full-stack engineer and Machine Learning engineer for Apple, Microsoft and Twitter.
 
I recently published my first tech book, [_Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures_](https://www.manning.com/books/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures), take a peek on [Manning's livebook](https://livebook.manning.com/book/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures) or check out [this repository](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction) with the code.
(All code is free to access)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on
    - [JsGraphs](https://github.com/mlarocca/jsgraphs)
    - [A&DSiA](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning **quantum computing**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: _algorithms | machine learning | web applications | system design | quantum computing | JavaScript | Python | Java | Scala_
- âš¡ Fun fact: I will come up with something, one day, I swear...
